# Coding and Vulnerabilities Detection with GitHub Copilot

## 💫 Overview
In this repository, we explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot in various coding scenarios. The focus is on how Copilot can assist in writing code, refactoring, and detecting security vulnerabilities.


## 💻 **Coding**

Let's dive into some practical examples to see how GitHub Copilot handles these common coding tasks.

For these initial examples, we’ll be using Comment-Driven Development—a simple but powerful way of leveraging Copilot. We’ll start by writing comments that describe what we want to achieve, and Copilot will automatically suggest the corresponding code.

Later on, we'll also explore using Copilot Chat to go deeper into more complex scenarios, where the conversation with the AI becomes a more interactive part of the development process.

### Loops

Let’s start with a simple for loop. For instance, we need to iterate over an array of numbers in JavaScript. Instead of writing the whole loop from scratch, we can just start typing and Copilot will help us complete it:

First, we must create a `basic-snippets.ts` file in the `coding` folder. Then, we can write a comment describing what we want to do:

```typescript
// Create an array of numbers and loop through it
```

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach((number) => {
  console.log(number);
});
```

As you can see, Copilot suggests the entire loop structure based on the comment, allowing us to quickly move forward without worrying about boilerplate code.


### Conditionals

Next, let’s look at conditional statements. Imagine we want to check if a number is even or odd in JavaScript. Copilot can automatically generate the entire if-else block based on just a comment:

```typescript
// Check if a number is even or odd
```

```typescript
const number = 5;

if (number % 2 === 0) {
  console.log(`${number} is even`);
} else {
  console.log(`${number} is odd`);
}
```
Copilot understands the task and offers the complete logic for this check just from the initial comment.


### Data Structures

Let’s move on to **data structures**. Whether it's initializing an array or creating an object, Copilot helps us by suggesting code automatically. For example, when we need to define an array and loop through it in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Initialize an array of strings and print each string
```

```typescript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
fruits.forEach((fruit) => {
  console.log(fruit);
});
```

Copilot quickly generates this basic class structure with just a few hints from the comment.

### Functions

Lastly, let’s look at functions. If we want to write a simple function to add two numbers, Copilot can generate the function body based on a comment like this:

```typescript
// Create a function to sum two numbers
```

```typescript
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```
Again, just from the comment, Copilot fills in the logic for us.

In these examples, we used **Comment-Driven Development**, where our comments drive Copilot to generate code. Later, we'll explore Copilot Chat, which allows for a more interactive coding experience.

---

**Now that we've seen how GitHub Copilot helps with basic code snippets, let’s move on to something more complex.**

In this section, we’ll explore how Copilot Chat can assist in generating complex functions and algorithms. This includes tasks like implementing sorting algorithms, search functions, and performing advanced data manipulations.

One of the key advantages of Copilot Chat is its ability to help you write and refine more intricate code. You can ask specific questions, get explanations for algorithmic concepts, and have Copilot suggest code that fits your particular needs.

**Now, we'll ask Copilot Chat to assist us in generating code for some popular algorithms and functions. First, we'll start with a sorting algorithm.**

### **Sorting Algorithm**

We’ll use **Copilot Chat** to help us implement a common sorting algorithm—merge sort. Merge sort is a classic example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

First, create a `complex.ts` file in the coding folder. Then, we can ask Copilot Chat to help us implement the merge sort algorithm:

👤 Prompt:
```plaintext
How can I implement merge sort in TypeScript?
```
🤖 Copilot Answer:

```plaintext
Sure, here's a step-by-step plan to implement merge sort in TypeScript:

1. **Define the merge function**: This function will merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
2. **Define the mergeSort function**: This function will recursively split the array into halves and then merge them back together in sorted order.

Here's the implementation:
```

```typescript
function merge(left: number[], right: number[]): number[] {
  let result: number[] = [];
  let leftIndex = 0;
  let rightIndex = 0;

  while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
    if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
      result.push(left[leftIndex]);
      leftIndex++;
    } else {
      result.push(right[rightIndex]);
      rightIndex++;
    }
  }

  // Concatenate the remaining elements
  return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}

function mergeSort(array: number[]): number[] {
  if (array.length <= 1) {
    return array;
  }

  const middle = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
  const left = array.slice(middle);
  const right = array.slice(0, middle);

  return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

// Example usage:
const array = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10];
console.log(mergeSort(array)); // Output: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
```

As you can see, Copilot Chat provides the entire structure of merge sort, including the recursive splitting of the array and the merging process. This is a great example of how Copilot Chat helps generate complex algorithms.

### **Search Functions**

Next, let’s ask Copilot Chat to help us with a search function—binary search. This is a more efficient way to search a sorted array, using a divide-and-conquer approach similar to merge sort.

You can ask:

👤 Prompt:
```plaintext
Can you help me write a binary search function in TypeScript?
```
🤖 Copilot Answer:

```plaintext
Sure, here's a step-by-step plan to implement a binary search function in TypeScript:

1. **Define the binarySearch function**: This function will take a sorted array, a target value, and optionally the start and end indices.
2. **Base Case**: If the start index is greater than the end index, return -1 (indicating the target is not found).
3. **Calculate the middle index**: Use the start and end indices to find the middle index.
4. **Compare the middle element with the target**:
   - If they are equal, return the middle index.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, recursively search the left half.
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, recursively search the right half.

Here's the implementation:
```

```typescript
function binarySearch(
  array: number[],
  target: number,
  start: number = 0,
  end: number = array.length - 1
): number {
  if (start > end) {
    return -1;
  }

  const middle = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

  if (array[middle] === target) {
    return middle;
  } else if (array[middle] > target) {
    return binarySearch(array, target, start, middle - 1);
  } else {
    return binarySearch(array, target, middle + 1, end);
  }
}

// Example usage:
const sortedArray = [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82];
const target = 27;
console.log(binarySearch(sortedArray, target)); // Output: 3
```

With this, we now have an efficient way to search a sorted array. Copilot Chat provides the binary search function with all the correct logic, including edge cases.

### **Data Manipulation**

Lastly, let's use Copilot Chat to assist us with a more complex data manipulation task. Suppose we want to group objects by a certain property in an array of objects

👤 Prompt:
```plaintext
How can I group an array of objects by a specific property in TypeScript?
```

🤖 Copilot Answer:

```plaintext
To group an array of objects by a specific property in TypeScript, you can use the `reduce` method to iterate through the array and build an object where each key is a unique value of the specified property, and the corresponding value is an array of objects that share that property value.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function that takes an array of objects and the property to group by.
2. **Use `reduce`**: Iterate through the array using the `reduce` method.
3. **Build the grouped object**: For each object, check if the property value already exists as a key in the result object. If it does, push the object to the array at that key. If it doesn't, create a new array with the object.

Here's the implementation:
```

```typescript
// Group an array of objects by a specific property
function groupBy(arr, property) {
  return arr.reduce((acc, obj) => {
    let key = obj[property];
    if (!acc[key]) {
      acc[key] = [];
    }
    acc[key].push(obj);
    return acc;
  }, {});
}

// Example usage
let people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 25 },
  { name: "David", age: 30 },
  { name: "Eve", age: 35 },
];

let groupedByAge = groupBy(people, "age");
console.log(groupedByAge);
```

This code takes an array of objects and groups them based on the provided property. Copilot Chat efficiently creates this utility function, which can be adapted to other use cases.

**Now, let's explore how GitHub Copilot can assist in generating project templates for various types of applications.**

Creating the foundation of a project is often one of the most time-consuming steps. Whether we’re working on a web app or an API , there are common patterns, configurations, and boilerplate code that we need to set up.

Copilot can help us speed up this process by generating the basic project structure, setting up configuration files, and providing common starter code for frameworks and environments.

### Web Application Template (Next.js)

For instance, let’s say we want to create a template for a simple Next.js web application. Copilot can help generate the basic structure and initial setup.

For the next prompt we are going to use some of the agents and commands that we mentioned early. In this case we are going to use the workspace agent and the new command to create a new workspace.

👤Prompt:

```plaintext
@workspace /new Create the folder structure and a simple index.js page for a Next.js web application.
```

As you can see, by leveraging the @workspace command, Copilot quickly generates a fully functional folder structure and initial setup for our project. This can drastically reduce the time needed to get started on new projects

### API Template (NestJS)

Next, let's try creating a template for an API using **NestJS**. This time, we want a simple REST API

👤Prompt:

```plaintext
@workspace /new "create a nestjs api with one entity called products, this entity has 4 attributes, id: string, name: string, description: string, image: string, using typeorm 0.3.20 for persistence and Postgres adapter"
```

In just a few lines, Copilot sets up the structure and the basic functionality for an api in NestJS. This is a great way to quickly get a starting point for an API, allowing us to focus on the business logic rather than boilerplate code.

---

### 🛠️ **Refactoring and Optimization**

In this section, we’ll explore how GitHub Copilot can assist in refactoring and optimizing existing code. Refactoring is an essential part of software development, as it helps improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.

> ℹ️ For this section, you need to navigate to the `refactoring` folder in the `coding` directory and install dependencies `npm install`. This folder contains files that we will use to demonstrate how Copilot can help us refactor and optimize code.

#### Step 1: Detecting Redundant Code

Common examples of redundant code include:

1. **Duplicated logic**: Repeating the same logic or functionality in multiple parts of the code instead of reusing it via functions, methods, or classes.
2. **Unnecessary variables**: Declaring variables that are never used, or assigning values to variables that never change.
3. **Superfluous conditions**: Including conditions in control structures that will never be met or are already implied.
4. **Unused dependencies**: Importing modules, libraries, or packages that are not actually used in the code.
5. **"Dead" code**: Code fragments that never execute, such as functions that are never called or sections within conditionals that are always false.


Issues with redundant code:

1. **Harder maintenance**: If a functionality is repeated in several places, making changes becomes more difficult and prone to errors.
2. **Increased complexity**: More lines of code make the program harder to read and understand.
3. **Performance impact**: In some cases, redundant code can consume more resources than necessary, affecting the application's performance.

👤 Prompt:

```plaintext
Can you help detect redundant or duplicate code in this project? I'm specifically looking for code that may be repeated across different functions or areas, or any code that could be simplified or refactored for better performance and maintainability. Let me know if you understand my request, and then I'll provide you with the files to analyze.
```

👤 Prompt: 

```
@workspace the first file to analyze is #file:userService.ts
```

👤 Prompt: 
```
now can you check this file for redundant or duplicate code ? #file:taskService.ts
```

Copilot will give you the improved code, you can test the app to check if everything is working.


#### Step 2: Optimize complex code

Optimizing complex code involves simplifying functions by breaking them into smaller, more focused tasks, each with a clear responsibility. Reducing deep nesting, avoiding redundant logic, and keeping code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) helps streamline the workflow


👤 Prompt: 

```
@workspace Can you help optimize complex code in this project? I'm looking to simplify large functions by breaking them into smaller, more focused tasks, reduce deep nesting, and eliminate any redundant logic. Please let me know if you understand my request and I will let you know which file to check
```

👤 Prompt: 

```
This file #file:taskController.ts has a lot of responsabilities, can you help me to simplify it following the project structure with route, controller and service
```

Copilot will give us the refactored code. Test the app to check if everything is working.

### **Demonstrate How GitHub Copilot Helps in Writing Unit Tests**

In this next section, we’ll explore how GitHub Copilot can assist in writing unit tests. Unit tests are essential for ensuring that individual components of your code work as expected. They help catch bugs early and provide a safety net when making changes to the codebase.


Let's ask GitHub Copilot to help us write unit tests for a function.

Open the `helloService.ts` file and select the function you want to test.

👤 Prompt: 

```plaintext
@workspace /tests Generate unit test for #selection
```

Now we are going to generate unit tests for the `userService.ts` file.

## ⚠️ **Detecting and Mitigating Security Vulnerabilities with GitHub Copilot** 🔍

Now, let's explore how GitHub Copilot can can assist in identifying potential security vulnerabilities in your code. Copilot not only helps in detecting these threats but also provides explanations of the vulnerabilities and suggests ways to fix them.

In this step we are going to ask Copilot to help us analyze the security of some files and identify any potential vulnerabilities, especially those related to:

1. **SQL Injection**: Malicious SQL code execution through user inputs.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.
4. **Broken Authentication**: Compromised authentication mechanisms.
5. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Inadequate protection of sensitive information.

#### Step 1: Tell to GitHub Copilot to help you to review the security of your files.

👤Prompt:

```
I need your assistance in reviewing the security of some files. Please help identify any potential vulnerabilities, especially those related to:

SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Broken Authentication
Sensitive Data Exposure
If you find any other security issues, please flag them as well. For each vulnerability, provide a brief explanation of why it's a threat and how it can be exploited. Also, suggest best practices or code improvements to mitigate these vulnerabilities effectively. Please let me now if you understand my requirement and then I'm going to specify you the file to scan.
```

👤 Prompt:

```
let start with the #file:example1.ts
```

🤖 Copilot Chat Answer

```
Let's review the provided code for potential vulnerabilities:

1. SQL Injection
Threat: SQL Injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate a SQL query by injecting malicious input. This can lead to unauthorized data access or modification.

Exploitation: An attacker can input a string like example@example.com' OR '1'='1 which would make the query return all users.

Mitigation: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection.

2. Sensitive Data Exposure
Threat: Hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials in the source code can lead to data exposure if the code is leaked.

Exploitation: If someone gains access to the source code, they can use the credentials to access the database.

Mitigation: Use environment variables to store sensitive information.

3. Broken Authentication
Threat: The code does not handle authentication or authorization, which could allow unauthorized access to user data.

Exploitation: Anyone who can call this function can access user data without any checks.

Mitigation: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks.

Suggested Code Improvements
Step-by-Step Plan
Use environment variables for sensitive data.
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Add authentication and authorization checks.

...
```

Now, analyze the file #file example2.ts (repeat the same process with the next file until the example5.ts)

**As you can see, security is a critical aspect of development, and GitHub Copilot offers valuable support by identifying vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and more.**

By detecting these issues early and providing suggestions for fixes, Copilot helps ensure your code is more resilient against common security threats, protecting both your application and its users.

#### Step 2: STRIDE Threat Modeling Framework

In this step, we're going to ask GitHub Copilot about the STRIDE threat modeling framework and how it applies to identifying security threats. STRIDE is a well-known framework used to categorize potential security risks, and by engaging Copilot, we'll see how it can assist us in understanding and applying these concepts to our code


**STRIDE**

A threat modeling framework used to identify and categorize potential security threats in software systems. It was developed by Microsoft and is widely used in the field of cybersecurity to help developers and security professionals systematically analyze the security risks associated with a system. The acronym STRIDE stands for:

1. **Spoofing**: The threat of an attacker impersonating another user or system to gain unauthorized access.
2. **Tampering**: The threat of unauthorized modification or corruption of data, code, or configuration settings.
3. **Repudiation**: The threat that a user or attacker could deny having performed an action without other parties being able to prove otherwise, often due to a lack of proper logging or auditing.
4. **Information Disclosure**: The threat of exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties, leading to privacy breaches or data leaks.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The threat of an attack that disrupts the normal functioning of a system, making it unavailable to its intended users.
6. **Elevation of Privilege**: The threat that an attacker could gain elevated access rights or privileges within a system, potentially allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized to do.

```

🤖 Copilot Chat Answer:

```
Yes, I have knowledge of the STRIDE threat modeling framework. Here's a brief explanation:

STRIDE Framework
STRIDE is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft to help identify security threats in software systems. It stands for:

Spoofing: Impersonating something or someone else.

Threat: Unauthorized access by pretending to be a legitimate user.
Mitigation: Strong authentication mechanisms.
Tampering: Modifying data or code.

Threat: Unauthorized changes to data or code.
Mitigation: Integrity checks, digital signatures.
Repudiation: Denying an action without a way to prove otherwise.

Threat: Users denying they performed an action.
Mitigation: Logging and auditing.
Information Disclosure: Exposing information to unauthorized users.

Threat: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Mitigation: Encryption, access controls.
Denial of Service (DoS): Making a system unavailable.

Threat: Overloading the system to make it unavailable.
Mitigation: Rate limiting, resource management.
Elevation of Privilege: Gaining higher privileges than allowed.

Threat: Unauthorized access to higher-level functions.
Mitigation: Proper access controls, least privilege principle.
Applying STRIDE to Identify Security Threats
When analyzing a file or system, you can use the STRIDE framework to systematically identify potential security threats:

Spoofing: Check for authentication mechanisms and ensure they are robust.
Tampering: Look for data integrity checks and protections against unauthorized modifications.
Repudiation: Ensure actions are logged and can be audited.
Information Disclosure: Verify that sensitive data is protected and not exposed.
Denial of Service: Identify potential points of overload and ensure protections are in place.
Elevation of Privilege: Check access controls and ensure users cannot gain unauthorized privileges.
Please specify the file you would like me to analyze using the STRIDE framework.
```

👤Prompt:

```
the file to analize using STRIDE framework is: #file:example6.ts
```

Now that we've gone over the STRIDE framework and how it helps identify security threats, we asked GitHub Copilot to analyze a file using this method. This shows how Copilot can help us find issues like Spoofing, Tampering, or Denial of Service in our code. By using Copilot, we can make sure potential security risks are spotted and handled more easily and quickly.
